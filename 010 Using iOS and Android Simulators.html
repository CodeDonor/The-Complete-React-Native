<p>These instructions are for students who wish to use the XCode or Android Studio simulators instead of a physical device with Expo.</p><p>keep in mind, emulators require a lot of RAM, so you may find that bundling and displaying code takes much longer than when using a physical device.</p><p>The official Expo docs with some troubleshooting tips are available here:</p><p><a href="https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator</a></p><p><a href="https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator</a></p><h4><strong>macOS </strong></h4><p><strong>XCode iOS&nbsp;Simulator</strong></p><ol><li><p>Download the full version of Xcode from the App Store.

You can, however, use a physical iOS device running Expo with your Windows machine.</p><p><strong>Android Studio Simulator</strong></p><p>Make sure Virtualization is enabled in your BIOS. Also, note, your processor must support <a href="https://github.com/intel/haxm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HAXM</a>. If it does not (which is common with many AMD or non-Intel machines) you will likely not be able to run the simulators.
